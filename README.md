odin recipes website

My first attempt at a very basic website using HTML, no doubt adding in other languages such as CSS and JAVASCRIPT later on in the course, but for now, nailing down the basics.

I am hoping to grasp the basics to build a solid foundation that will stay with me throughout this journey on the path to a career change in web development.

Practice makes permanent!
